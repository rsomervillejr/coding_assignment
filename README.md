# coding_assignment
#### coding assignment for BCD Travel

## summary
Included are solutions to Problems 1 and 2 from the take home coding challenge.  There are 2 solutions for Problem 1, as I wanted to provide better efficiency than my first attempt.

I estimated that I'd spend an hour on each problem.  But ended up spending about 2.5 hours on Problem 1 (including both versions) and less than an hour on Problem 2.
